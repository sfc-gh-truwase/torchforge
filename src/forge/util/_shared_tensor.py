class SharedTensor:
    """
    Wrapper class for tensors backed by shared memory.

    This class provides a way to share tensors between processes using POSIX shared memory.
    It's designed for efficient inter-process tensor communication without copying data.

    Ownership and Lifecycle Model:
    ------------------------------
    1. **Creator process**:
       - Creates SharedTensor with tensor data or empty
       - Gets a handle via get_handle() to pass to other processes
       - **MUST** call close() after getting handle to release its reference
       - **SHOULD** call drop()/unlink() when all processes are done

    2. **Receiver processes**:
       - Receive SharedTensorHandle (via RPC, pickle, etc.)
       - Create SharedTensor from handle: SharedTensor(handle=handle)
       - Use the tensor: handle.to_shared_tensor().tensor
       - **MUST** call close() when done using the tensor

    3. **Cleanup**:
       - close(): Closes this process's file descriptor/handle
       - drop()/unlink(): Marks shared memory for deletion (call once, from any process)
       - Actual memory is freed when all processes have closed AND unlink is called

    Memory Leak Prevention:
    ----------------------
    - **DO NOT** rely on __del__ for cleanup! Python GC is unpredictable.
    - **ALWAYS** explicitly call close() when done with a SharedTensor
    - **ALWAYS** call drop() on handles when sharing is complete
    - Use context manager (with statement) for automatic cleanup
    - After close(), accessing .tensor will raise RuntimeError
    - After close(), getting handle will raise RuntimeError

    Closed State Behavior:
    ---------------------
    - Once close() is called, the SharedTensor enters a closed state
    - Accessing .tensor after close() raises RuntimeError
    - Calling get_handle() after close() raises RuntimeError
    - You can check the state with the .is_closed property
    - close() and drop() are idempotent (safe to call multiple times)

    Important Warning:
    ------------------
    If you hold a reference to the tensor BEFORE calling close(), that
    reference becomes INVALID after close():
        t = shared.tensor  # Get reference
        shared.close()     # Close SharedTensor - unmaps memory
        t.sum()            # SEGFAULT! The memory is now invalid

    After close(), the shared memory mapping is unmapped, so ALL references
    to the tensor (including cached ones) point to invalid memory. Accessing
    them will cause segmentation faults or undefined behavior.

    Always ensure you're done with the tensor before calling close().

    Example Usage:
    -------------
    # Creator process
    tensor = torch.randn(100, 100)
    shared = SharedTensor(tensor=tensor)
    handle = shared.get_handle()
    shared.close()  # Close creator's reference
    # ... send handle to other process via RPC ...
    handle.drop()  # Unlink after all receivers have it

    # Receiver process
    # ... receive handle via RPC ...
    shared = SharedTensor(handle=handle)
    result = shared.tensor.sum()  # Use the tensor
    shared.close()  # Close receiver's reference

    # Or use context manager (recommended)
    with SharedTensor(handle=handle) as shared:
        result = shared.tensor.sum()
    # Automatically closed
