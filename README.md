#### A PyTorch-native agentic RL library that lets you focus on algorithms—not infra.

## Overview
The primary purpose of the torchforge ecosystem is to separate infra concerns from model concerns thereby making RL experimentation easier. torchforge delivers this by providing clear RL abstractions and one scalable implementation of these abstractions. When you need fine-grained control over placement, fault handling/redirecting training loads during a run, or communication patterns, the primitives are there. When you don’t, you can focus purely on your RL algorithm.

Key features:
- Usability for rapid research (isolating the RL loop from infrastructure)
- Hackability for power users (all parts of the RL loop can be easily modified without interacting with infrastructure)
- Scalability (ability to shift between async and synchronous training and across thousands of GPUs)

> ⚠️ **Early Development Warning** torchforge is currently in an experimental
> stage. You should expect bugs, incomplete features, and APIs that may change
> in future versions. The project welcomes bugfixes, but to make sure things are
> well coordinated you should discuss any significant change before starting the
> work. It's recommended that you signal your intention to contribute in the
> issue tracker, either by filing a new issue or by claiming an existing one.

## Tutorials

You can also find our notebook tutorials (coming soon)

## Installation

torchforge requires PyTorch 2.9.0 with [Monarch](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/monarch), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), and [torchtitan](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan).

### Conda

Install torchforge with:

```bash
conda create -n forge python=3.12
conda activate forge
./scripts/install.sh
```

#### ROCm Installation

ROCm users can install with the dedicated script:

```bash
conda create -n forge python=3.12
conda activate forge
./scripts/install_rocm.sh
```

Notes:
- `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH` is auto-detected when possible; set it manually if detection fails (example: `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx942`).
- `ROCM_VERSION` is auto-detected when possible; set it manually if detection fails (example: `ROCM_VERSION=6.4`).
- For ROCm 7.x, PyTorch stable 2.9.0 is not available. The script defaults to nightly wheels. You can override with `PYTORCH_CHANNEL=stable|nightly`.
- ROCm builds install Monarch with `USE_TENSOR_ENGINE=0`, so RDMA and distributed tensor features are disabled for now.
- Optional flags: `--use-sudo` (system packages) and `--skip-amdsmi` (skip amdsmi install).

The install script installs system dependencies along with torchforge. Note that this install script uses [DNF](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/), but could be easily extended to other Linux OS.

Optional: By default, the packages installation uses conda. If you want to install system packages on the target machine instead of conda, you can pass the `--use-sudo` flag to the installation script: `./scripts/install.sh --use-sudo`.

### Pixi

Pixi combines benefits of uv with access to conda forge for system dependencies. [pixi.toml](./pixi.toml) provides a manifest with build tasks with `install` as a the combined install all task.

Install pixi:
```
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Install torchforge with pixi:
```
pixi run install
```

> **Note:** We are actively working on enabling pure `uv` installation. Currently, Conda is the recommended approach. `uv` support is not fully working at the moment but is being tracked in [issue #494](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/torchforge/issues/494).

After install, you can run the following command and should see output confirming GRPO training is running (you need a minimum 3 GPU devices):

```
python -m apps.grpo.main --config apps/grpo/qwen3_1_7b.yaml
```

## Quick Start

To run SFT on a Llama3 8B model, run

```bash
python -m apps.sft.main --config apps/sft/llama3_8b.yaml
```
